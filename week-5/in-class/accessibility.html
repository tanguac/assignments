                    An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young
                    Frog
                    into
                    the
                    mud. The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of
                    him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "A great big monster," said one of them, "stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Big, was he!" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. "Was he as big as this?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Oh, much bigger!" they cried.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Frog puffed up still more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "He could not have been bigger than this," she said. But the little Frogs all declared that the
                    monster was
                    much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she
                    burst.

            <section class="content">
                <p>The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot leave
                    home. They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would
                    not go to Jupiter’s wedding, even when especially invited.</p>
                <p>After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds
                    flew about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager
                    to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented. He wanted to
                    see the world too, and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly
                    drag him along.</p>
                <p>One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble.</p>
                <p>“We can help you to see the world,” said the Ducks. “Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we
                    will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside. But keep quiet or you will
                    be sorry.”</p>
                <p>The Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick firmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold
                    of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds.</p>
                <p>Just then a Crow flew by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried:</p>
                <p>“This must surely be the King of Tortoises!”</p>
                <p>“Why certainly——” began the Tortoise.</p>
                <p>But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick, and down he fell
                    to the ground, where he was dashed to pieces on a rock.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least
                they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away.
                Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly
                dared stir from their dens by night or day.</p>
            <p>Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up
                and said:</p>
            <p>“I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful. All we have to do is to hang a
                bell about the Cat’s neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is
                coming.”</p>
            <p>All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the
                rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said:</p>
            <p>“I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the
                Cat?”</p>
            <p class="moral">It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do
                it.</p>

            <h2>About Æsop</h2>

            <p><span class="person">Æsop</span> (pronounced /ˈiːsɒp/ ee-sop, Ancient Greek: Αἴσωπος, Aisōpos, c. 620–564
                BC)
                was a fabulist or story teller
                credited with a number of fables now collectively known as Æsop's Fables. Although his existence remains
                uncertain and (if they ever existed) no writings by him survive, numerous tales credited to him were
                gathered
                across the centuries and in many languages in a storytelling tradition that continues to this day. Many
                of
                the
                tales are characterized by animals and inanimate objects that speak, solve problems, and generally have
                human
                characteristics.</p>
