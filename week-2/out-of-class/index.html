            <h3>Predecessor circuses</h3>
            <p>
              Hachaliah Bailey appears to have established the first circus in the United States after he purchased an African
              Elephant, which he named "Old Bet", around <time datetime="1806">1806</time>. With it as his star attraction he formed 
              the Bailey Circus, which also included a trained dog, several pigs, a horse and four wagons. This was the impetus for what 
              in time evolved into the Bailey component of what became the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
            </p>
            <p>
              P. T. Barnum, who as a boy had worked as a ticket seller for Hachaliah Bailey's show, had run the Barnum's American
              Museum from New York City since <time datetime="1841">1841</time> from the former Scudder's American Museum building. 
              Besides building up the existing exhibits, Barnum brought in animals to add zoo-like elements, and a freak show. During 
              this time, Barnum took the Museum on road tours, named "P.T. Barnum's Grand Traveling American Museum". The Museum burned 
              down in <time datetime="1865-07">July 1865</time>. Though Barnum attempted to re-establish the Museum at another location 
              in the city, it too burned down in <time datetime="1868">1868</time>, and Barnum opted to retire from the museum business.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <time datetime="1871">1871</time>, Dan Castello and William Cameron Coup persuaded Barnum to come out of retirement as to 
              lend his name, know-how and financial backing to the circus they had already created in Delavan, Wisconsin. The combined show 
              was named "P.T. Barnum's Great Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan, and Hippodrome". As described by Barnum, Castello and 
              Coup <q>had a show that was truly immense, and combined all the elements of museum, menagerie, variety performance, concert 
              hall, and circus</q>, and considered it to potentially be <q>the Greatest Show on Earth,</q> which subsequently became part of 
              the circus's name.
            </p>
            <p>
              Independently of Castello and Coup, James Anthony Bailey had teamed up with James E. Cooper to create the Cooper and
              Bailey Circus in the 1860s. The Cooper and Bailey Circus became the chief competitor to Barnum's circus. As Bailey's
              circus was outperforming his, Barnum sought to merge the circuses. The two groups agreed to combine their shows
              on <time datetime="1881-03-28">March 28, 1881</time>. Initially named "P.T. Barnum's Greatest Show On Earth, And The Great 
              London Circus, Sanger's Royal British Menagerie and The Grand International Allied Shows United", it was eventually shortened 
              to "Barnum and Bailey's Circus". Bailey was instrumental in acquiring Jumbo, advertised as the world's largest elephant, for 
              the show. Barnum died in <time datetime="1891">1891</time> and Bailey then purchased the circus from his widow. Bailey continued 
              touring the eastern United States until he took his circus to Europe. That tour started on <time datetime="1897-12-27">
              December 27, 1897</time>, and lasted until <time datetime="1902">1902</time>.  
            </p>   
            <p>
              Separately, in <time datetime="1884">1884</time>, five of the seven Ringling brothers had started a small circus in Baraboo, 
              Wisconsin. This was about the same time that Barnum & Bailey were at the peak of their popularity. Similar to dozens of small
              circuses that toured the Midwest and the Northeast at the time, the brothers moved their circus from town to town in
              small animal-drawn caravans. Their circus rapidly grew and they were soon able to move their circus by train, which
              allowed them to have the largest traveling amusement enterprise of that time. Bailey's European tour gave the
              Ringling brothers an opportunity to move their show from the Midwest to the eastern seaboard. Faced with the new
              competition, Bailey took his show west of the Rocky Mountains for the first time in <time datetime="1905">1905</time>. 
              He died the next year, and the circus was sold to the Ringling Brothers.

            <h3>Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus</h3>
            <p>
              The Ringlings purchased the Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show on Earth in <time datetime="1907">1907</time> and ran the circuses 
              separately until <time datetime="1919">1919</time>. By that time, Charles Edward Ringling and John Nicholas Ringling were the 
              only remaining brothers of the five who founded the circus. They decided that it was too difficult to run the two circuses 
              independently, and on <time datetime="1919-03-29">March 29, 1919</time>, "Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows" 
              debuted in New York City. The posters declared, "The Ringling Bros. World's Greatest Shows and the Barnum & Bailey Greatest 
              Show on Earth are now combined into one record-breaking giant of all exhibitions." Charles E. Ringling died in 
              <time datetime="1926">1926</time>, but the circus flourished through the Roaring Twenties.
            </p>
            <p>
              John Ringling had the circus move its headquarters to Sarasota, Florida in <time datetime="1927">1927</time>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <time datetime="1929">1929</time>, the American Circus Corporation signed a contract to perform in New York City. John 
              Ringling purchased American Circus, owner of five circuses, for $1.7 million.      
            </p>
            <p>
              In <time datetime="1938">1938</time>, the circus made a lucrative offer to Frank Buck, a well-known adventurer and animal 
              collector, to tour as their star attraction and to enter the show astride an elephant. He refused to join the American 
              Federation of Actors, stating that he was <q>a scientist, not an actor.</q> Though there was a threat of a strike if he did 
              not join the union, he maintained that he would not compromise his principles, saying, <q>Don't get me wrong. I'm with the
              working man. I worked like a dog once myself. And my heart is with the fellow who works. But I don't want some ...
              union delegate telling me when to get on and off an elephant.</q> Eventually, the union gave Buck a special
              dispensation to introduce Gargantua the gorilla without registering as an actor.      
            </p>
            <p>
              The circus suffered during the 1930s due to the Great Depression, but managed to stay in business. After John
              Nicholas Ringling's death, his nephew, John Ringling North, managed the indebted circus twice, the first from 
              <time datetime="1937">1937</time> to <time datetime="1943">1943</time>. Special dispensation was given to the circus by 
              President Roosevelt to use the rails to operate in <time datetime="1942">1942</time>, in spite of travel restrictions imposed 
              as a result of World War II. Many of the most famous images from the circus that were published in magazine and posters were 
              captured by American Photographer Maxwell Frederic Coplan, who traveled the world with the circus, capturing its beauty as 
              well as its harsh realities.      
            </p>
            <p>
              North's cousin Robert took over the president of the show in <time datetime="1943">1943</time>. North resumed the presidency 
              of the circus in <time datetime="1947">1947</time>.

          <h2>Animal care and criticism</h2>
          <p>
            Many animal welfare and animal rights organizations are opposed to the use of wild animals in circuses. Many of
            these groups actively campaign against circuses by staging protests outside of venues over alleged animal rights
            violations. The groups argue that animals used in the circus are subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment during
            training, harsh conditions during transport, and a general lack of mental and physical stimulation.
