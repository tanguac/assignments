My website is a redesigning of the MIT Institute Archives & Special Collections(IASC) subpage of the MIT Libraries. The MIT Libraries fractal branding can be seen in the background of each page, as well as in the MIT Libraries header. I tested to ensure the cyan lines were of sufficient contrast to the text, and also placed transparent white backgrounds behind content boxes to help with text readability. 

The majority of the pages will hold basic content about IASC services, collections, and policies. The collections page also features a search box so that the content management system could be searched. Since the ArchivesSpace public user interface has yet to be implemented, the search function is disabled. The blogs page allows the user to view content from each of the three blogs featuring content about the IASC: The MIT Libraries News and Events filtered for items about the Archives and MIT History, Kari Smith's digital archives blog, and a general less-formal blog by the archives staff. This page uses PHP and JavaScript to pull in the blog content, and is based on modified code available from the W3C Schools tutorials. The contact us page currently has placeholder images for staff members, but could be replaced with small photographs of staff as they become available.
