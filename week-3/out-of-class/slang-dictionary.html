    <section class="content">

        <p>Slang, like everything else, changes much in the course of time; and though but fifteen years have elapsed
            since
            this
            Dictionary was first introduced to the public, alterations have since then been many and frequent in the
            subject
            of
            which it treats. The first issue of a work of this kind is, too, ever beset with difficulties, and the
            compiler
            was
            always aware that, though under the circumstances of its production the book was an undoubted success, it
            necessarily lacked many of the elements which would make that success lasting, and cause the “Slang
            Dictionary”
            to
            be regarded as an authority and a work of reference not merely among the uneducated, but among people of
            cultivated
            tastes and inquiring minds. For though the vulgar use of the word Slang applies to those words only which
            are
            used
            by the dangerous classes and the lowest grades of society, the term has in reality, and should have—as every
            one
            who
            has ever studied the subject knows—a much wider significance. Bearing this in mind, the original publisher
            of
            this
            Dictionary lost no opportunity of obtaining information of a useful kind, which could hardly find place in
            any
            other book of reference, with the intention of eventually bringing out an entirely new edition, in which all
            former
            errors should be corrected and all fresh meanings and new words find a place. His intention always was to
            give
            those
            words which are familiar to all conversant with our colloquialisms and locutions, but which have hitherto
            been
            connected with an unwritten tongue, a local habitation, and to produce a book which, in its way, would be as
            useful
            to students of philology, as well as to lovers of human nature in all its phases, as any standard work in
            the
            English language. The squeamishness which tries to ignore the existence of slang fails signally, for not
            only in
            the
            streets and the prisons, but at the bar, on the bench, in the pulpit, and in the Houses of Parliament, does
            slang
            make itself heard, and, as the shortest and safest means to an end, understood too.</p>

        <p>My predecessor, the original compiler, did not live to see his wish become an actual fact; and, failing him,
            it
            devolved upon me to undertake the task of revision and addition. How far this has been accomplished, the
            curious
            reader who is possessed of a copy of each edition can best judge for himself by comparing any couple of
            pages he
            may
            select. Of my own share in the work I wish to say nothing, as I have mainly benefited by the labours of
            others;
            but
            I may say that, when I undertook the position of editor of what, with the smallest possible stretch of
            fancy,
            may now be called a new book, I had no idea that the alteration would be nearly so large or so manifest.
            However, as
            the work is now done, it will best speak for itself, and, as good wine needs no bush, I will leave it, in
            all
            hope
            of their tenderness, to those readers who are best qualified to say how the task has been consummated.

        <p>In conclusion, it is but fair for me to thank, as strongly as weak words will permit, those gentlemen who
            have in
            various ways assisted me. To two of them, who are well known in the world of literature, and who have not
            only
            aided
            me with advice, but have placed many new words and etymologies at my service, I am under particular
            obligation.
            With
            this I beg to subscribe myself, the reader’s most obedient servant,

            Note.—The reader will bear in mind that this is a Dictionary of <em>modern</em> Slang,—a list of colloquial
            words
            and phrases in present use,—whether of ancient or modern formation. Whenever <em>Ancient</em> is appended to
            a
            word, it means that the
            expression was in respectable use in or previous to the reign of <span class="person">Queen Elizabeth</span>.
            Old or Old English, affixed to
            a
            word, signifies that it was in general use as a proper expression in or previous to the reign of <span
                class="person">Charles II</span>.
            <em>Old
                Cant</em>, indicates that the term was in use as a Cant word during or before the same reign.
        </p>
        <p id="publishers-note">
            The Publishers will be much obliged by the receipt of any cant, slang, or vulgar words not mentioned in the
            Dictionary. The probable origin, or etymology, of any fashionable or unfashionable vulgarism, will also be
            received
            with thanks.

            Slick. The highest classification of ships at Lloyd’s; common term in the United
            States; also at Liverpool and other English seaports. Another, even more
            intensitive form is <q>first-class, letter A, No. 1.</q> Some people choose to say <span class="term">A
        I</span>, for no reason, however, beyond that of being different from others.

        <dt id="chalks" class="term">Chalks</dt>
        <dd>“to walk one’s <span class="term">chalks</span>,” to move off, or run away. An ordeal for drunkenness used on board ship, to see
            whether
            the suspected person can walk on a chalked line without overstepping it on either side.
        </dd>

        <dt id="dovercourt" class="term">Dovercourt</dt>
        <dd>a noisy assemblage; <q>all talkers and no hearers, like <span class="term">Dovercourt</span>.</q> At
            Dovercourt,
            in Essex, a court is annually held; and as the members principally consist of rude fishermen, the
            irregularity
            noticed in the proverbial saying frequently prevails. <span class="person">Bramston</span> in his <cite>Art
                of Politics</cite> says:—
            <blockquote>Those who would captivate the well-bred throng,<br>
                Should not too often speak, nor speak too long;<br>
                Church, nor church matters, ever turn to sport,<br>
                Nor make St. Stephen’s Chapel Dover Court.
            </blockquote>
            This would seem to be more properly applied to a Court of Dover people, a Dover Court, not a Dovercourt
            Court.

        <dt id="long-tailed-beggar" class="term">Long-tailed beggar</dt>
        <dd>a cat. The tale that hangs thereby runs thus:—A boy, during his first very short voyage to sea, had become
            so
            entirely a seaman, that on his return he had forgotten the name of the cat, and was obliged, pointing to
            puss,
            to ask his mother <q>what she called that ’ere <span class="term">long-tailed beggar</span>?</q>
            Accordingly,
            sailors, when they hear a freshwater tar discoursing too largely on nautical matters, are very apt to say,
            <q>But
                how, mate, about that ’ere <span class="term">long-tailed beggar</span>?</q></dd>

        <dt id="old-boots" class="term">Old boots</dt>
        <dd>a simile as general in its application as it is irrelevant. <q>Like <span class="term">old boots</span></q>
            means like anything. <q>As cheeky as <span class="term">old boots</span>;</q> <q>As quick as <span
                    class="term">old boots</span>,</q> seem a little more reasonable, new boots being somewhat
            unfavourable
            to speedy locomotion.

            careful.
            Originating, according to some, from the similarity of p’s and q’s in the hornbook alphabet, and therefore
            the
            warning of an old dame to her pupils, or, according to others, of a French dancing-master to his pupils, to
            mind
            their pieds (feet) and queues (wigs) when bowing.
        </dd>

        <dt id="pigeon" class="term">Pigeon</dt>
        <dd>a gullible or soft person. The French cant, or Argot, has the word pigeon, <q lang="fr">pechon</q>, <q
                lang="fr">peschon de ruby</q>, <q lang="fr">apprenti gueux</q>, <q lang="fr">enfant (sans doute
            dérobé)</q>.
            The vagabonds and brigands of Spain also used the word in their Germania, or robbers’ language, <q
                    lang="es">palomo</q>
            (pigeon), ignorant, simple. In the sporting world sharps and flats are often called <q>rooks and
                pigeons</q> respectively—sometimes <q>spiders and flies.</q></dd>

        <dt id="pike-it" class="term">Pike it</dt>
        <dd>is said as a hasty and contemptuous, if not angry, dismissal, <q>if you don’t like it, take a short stick
            and
            <span class="term">pike it</span>.</q> This is but a form of the attempts at rhyming smartness common in
            London.
            <blockquote>Joe quickly his sand had sold, sir,<br>

            the last name in the classical honours’ list at Cambridge. The last in mathematical honours had long been
            known
            as the wooden spoon; but when the classical Tripos was instituted in 1824, it was debated among the
            undergraduates what sobriquet should be given to the last on the examination list. Curiously enough, the
            name
            that year which happened to be last was <span class="person">Wedgewood</span> (a distinguished Wrangler).
            Hence the title.
